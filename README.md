# loket-download-url-service
A microservice that periodically looks in the database for urls associated with inzending-voor-toezicht objects and tries to download and store their content locally, if not already stored. You can force it to run immediately by visiting /checkurls subroute. 
```
  FILE_STORAGE
    The local storage of files

  CACHING_MAX_RETRIES
    How many times will the service try to download a resource before considering it as failed.

  CACHING_CRON_PATTERN
    The time interval of service's re-execution.
```
## Installation
